This is the source code to create csv files from the pdf files provided by the CoMUn administration. 

### short explanation
The .txt files fed into the python code (2024.txt and 2025.txt) are created by simply copying and pasting the pdf files' text into an empty file. 
The program then parses the txt and turns it into a csv file that is later used in conjunction with the 
"Bulk create" feature in canva to produce the pdf with the diplomas. [Learn more about Bulk create](https://www.canva.com/help/bulk-create/)

### possible improvements
If needed, this can later be expanded to automatically create html diplomas from the csv file, thereby
automating almost the whole process.
